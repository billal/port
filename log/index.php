    <h3><b>April 2010</b></h3>
  
    <p>I went to the tenant meeting at Awesome Inc. yesterday and reported that I made 8 contacts in April, 
        bidded on three projects, and finished my portfolio. And that was it. But as the meeting went on, 
        I realized I actually did a lot more than that and I need to somehow make an attempt to remember 
        what all I've been up to.  In making the list I realized there were a few people I should have 
        contacted after some of the events.</p>
